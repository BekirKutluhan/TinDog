### What I learned

This challenge is super educational for bootstrap.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<!-- COL-CIRCLE -->
<div class="col-lg-4 ">
  <i class="fas fa-bullseye  color-red fa-4x"></i><br>
  <h3 class="Mont">Elite Clientele</h3>
  <p id="paragraphs1">We have all the dogs, the <br>greatest dogs.</p>
</div>
 ```CSS
 @media screen and (max-width:900px){
   #tindogimg{
     margin-top: 50px;
     width: 30%;
     transform: rotate(0);
   }
 #title{
     background-color: #ff4c68;
   }
```
